Introduction
--------------------

RamaPlayer is a lightweight media player for Windows that is operated exclusively through the keyboard. The interface is simple -- the player occupies the entire app window and the status bar at the bottom shows current position (if playing).

One unique quality of RamaPlayer is the ability to auto switch to the next track in the current folder (determined by a simple alphabetic order) as the current track finishes. SO this is great to use with tracks which have to be played in a sequence without having to create playlist etc. At the end of the last track, it restarts with the first track!

Another distinguishing quality is the multiple keyboard commands to rewind/forward from a very small time distance to a very large one (see below).

RamaPlayer can play anything what Windows Media Player  can -- nothing more and nothing less. It actually uses latter's ActiveX component for playback (did you expect another playback software from scratch? Sorry to disappoint you!)

Keyboard Commands
--------------------

- q to quit (close application)
- o to open brows file dialog
- space or p to toggle between pause/play
- m to toggle mute
- f to toggle fullscreen
- up/down arrows to increase or decrease volume, respectively
- w to jump to the previous track in the current folder immediately
- e to jump to the next track in the current folder immediately
- left/right arrows to rewind/forward, respectively by 4 seconds
- alt + left/right arrows to rewind/forward, respectively by 15 seconds
- ctrl + left/right arrows to rewind/forward, respectively by 40 seconds
- ctrl + shift + left/right arrows to rewind/forward, respectively by a minute
- pageup/pagedown  to rewind/forward, respectively by 20 percent of the total duration of the track. So if track duration is 40 minutes one pagedown advances current position by 10 minutes. For a 20 minutes track, the same will be advanced by 5 minutes.
